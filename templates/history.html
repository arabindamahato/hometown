    <p>The territory of present Purulia district was a part of Banga, one of the 16 Mahajanapadas according to 
        Jaina Bhagavati Sutra (c. 5th century CE) and was also a part of the country known as Vajra-bhumi in 
        ancient period.[2][3][4] During medieval period, this territory was regarded as part of Jharkhand 
        region. Little is known about Purulia before the British East India Company acquired this territory 
        by obtaining the grant of Diwani of the subahs of Bengal, Bihar, Odisha in 1765.</p>
